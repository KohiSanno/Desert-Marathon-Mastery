**Project Name: Desert Marathon Mastery (Java, File I/O)**

**Overview:**

Desert Marathon Mastery is a Java application that simulates an endurance race through a desert environment among three unique creature types (sandrunner, sponge, walker), each with distinct survival strategies under varying weather conditions. The game reads race data and weather patterns from a file, then dynamically calculates the survival status and progress of each competitor based on their water management abilities. The simulation concludes by identifying the creature that travels the furthest distance without depleting its water resources, demonstrating an innovative application of file I/O, object-oriented programming, and conditional logic in Java.

**Features:**

- Dynamic simulation of survival and movement across different weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy).
- File I/O for customizable race setups, including creature types, initial water levels, and weather sequences.
- User-friendly interface for file selection and winner announcement.
- Implementation of object-oriented principles for game logic and creature management.

**Technical Highlights:**

- Efficient use of Java for complex logic operations and file handling, ensuring smooth simulation flow.
- Application of object-oriented design principles for clear, modular code structure and easy maintenance.
- Strategic use of conditional statements to accurately model creature behavior and race dynamics under variable environmental conditions.
